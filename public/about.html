    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>"I've always been fascinated by everything that can be traced back to the artistic, 
      especially video games and music, and I've always liked the idea of giving shape to what I imagine. 
      For the past five years, I have started to try my hand at creating both video games and music,
      which are the mediums through which I try to express myself. For now, I spend my time into these activities 
      for personal pleasure, and currently I aspire to turn my passion for game development into a profession."
